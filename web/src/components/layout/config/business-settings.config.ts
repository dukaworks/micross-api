/**

 * Peer of {@link SYSTEM_SETTINGS_VIEW}: entering this workspace swaps the
 * root navigation for the business configuration groups. Requires the
 * `admin` role (see `routes/_authenticated/business-settings/route.tsx`).
 *
 * The workspace is not mounted under a single URL prefix: user management
 * and upstream supply predate it and still live on top-level routes
 * (`/users`, `/redemption-codes`, `/subscriptions`, `/channels`, `/models`).
 * Those paths must be matched here as well, otherwise opening one of them
 * renders its page while the sidebar falls back to the root navigation.
 * Their own route guards keep requiring the `admin` role, which is the same
 * threshold declared below, so widening the match cannot expose the view to
 * non-admins.
